# arch-i3-config
My config files for Arch with i3

Files put in the folder `_foo/bar` go in `/foo/bar`, and files put in `foo/bar` go in `~/foo/bar`.

This theme uses Inconsolata, Pathogen (vim), and Oh My Zsh.

To get pretty `ls` colors, put `` eval `dircolors ~/.dircolors_ansi` `` at the beginning of your `.zshrc`.
